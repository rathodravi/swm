                  Servet Wealth Management was built around the idea that
                  business, finances and personal life all tend to blend
                  together. Our founder Nathan created Servet Wealth Management
                  with these principals in mind. Nathan has a multi-cultural
                  family and wanted a name to reflect that. The name Servet is a
                  node to his wife’s Turkish culture as it is a word that means
                  fortune, and just as importantly, its English root word is
                  serve. Creating a business that was rooted in serving client’s
                  wealth was a fundamental principal and something we strive for
                  everyday.

              Prior to starting Servet Wealth Management, I began my career in
              2012 at Merrill Lynch where I built a successful practice helping
              clients meet their financial goals. I got my CERTIFIED FINANCIAL
              PLANNER certificate in 2019 so I could help clients through more
              complex financial planning scenarios. This is what I enjoy most
              about my job; taking real world challenges and finding solutions
              that clients can feel confident in implementing.

              Personally, I grew up camping and hiking our National Parks and
              count camping in Yosemite Valley amongst my favorite memories.
              When my wife and I travel to new cities, we enjoy renting bikes
              and riding around the city finding under-the-radar restaurants.
