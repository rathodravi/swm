            The Experienced Corporate Executive
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>
            John and Amanda are experienced corporate executives who have been
            working in their roles throughout the past decade. They are a highly
            compensated partnership with a complex benefits package that
            includes both restricted stock and deferred compensation. However,
            with two kids about to go to college, and their goal of retirement
            within eyesight, they are seeking guidance to maximize efficiency
            and minimize risk. While they have set aside enough money to cover
            yearly expenses, they are looking for ways to continue their current
            lifestyle without interruption. They have recently bought a second
            beachfront home, to spend time unwinding on long weekends, and wish
            to enjoy this next chapter with the tranquility that comes with
            careful preparation. John and Amandaâ€™s main concerns are the looming
            effects of taxes and risks inherent to highly concentrated stock
            positions. They desire increased insight into what their retirement
            is going to look like, along with assistance to confidently
            establish strategies going into retirement. To achieve the peace of
            mind they desire, they are seeking professional guidance through the
            process of selecting tax efficient strategies and are interested in
            learning about various wealth preservation tactics. Typically,
            clients like John and Amanda have a net worth of approximately $3 to
            $15 million dollars.

        <h4>How we work together:</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          We work to benefit clients like John and Amanda through our platinum
          level service. We begin with a robust review of their benefits
          package, after which we identify and outline the most efficient ways
          to think about investments from both a tax and risk perspective.
          Using our gathered data, we build an individualized income-based
          model, utilizing various cash flow strategies to minimize both risks
          and taxes. This tailor-made financial plan is finalized and then
          displayed within a simplified roadmap, removing all the complexity
          from their financial concerns, allowing them to enjoy retirement
          with a peace of mind.
